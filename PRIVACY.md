## Meme-Indexer: Privacy policy

Welcome to the Meme-Indexer app for Android!

This is an open source Android app developed by Jatin Saini. The source code is available on GitHub under the GPL-3.0 license; the app is also available on Google Play.

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information but it might happen that the app indexes some PII documents/images which exist in the user selected subdirectories. Additionaly, Meme-Indexer stores locally some usage history(memes shared, words searched & directories indexed), to help user experience but that can be easily cleared or permanently disabled from within the app itself starting from version 1.2.0. 

All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.), indexed OCR data & usage history) created by you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

If you find any security vulnerability that has been inadvertently caused by me, or have any question regarding how the app protectes your privacy, please send me an email and I will surely try to fix it/help you.

Yours sincerely,
