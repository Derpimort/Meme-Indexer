## Plans

 - [ ] Improve the ocr model, currently using google's base default. Plan to use EAST with PyTorch, CRAFT gives better results but is much slower.
 - [ ] Just a thought... Read aloud the text from memes, like on request from the google assistant or something idk.
 - [ ] Switch between Black/White themes.
 - [ ] Deploy on cake day ez downloads and karma.

## Testing

 - I'll start releasing signed apks on github as soon as i'm done with the basic features. 
 - If you wanna test before that or develop... just clone this repo, point Android studio to the directory and let it do it's magic.
